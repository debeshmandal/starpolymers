# Yukawa

## Summary

In this section we present a method for simulating systems of polyelectrolytes using
implicit-solvent, implicit-salt, screened-electrostatics models, which use a Lennard-Jones
potential for excluded volume simulations, a Yukawa potential to simulate screened electrostatics,
and a harmonic potential to approximate the energy of covalent bonds between bonded particles.
